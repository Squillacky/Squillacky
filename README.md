### About Me

I am a former CFO and U.S. Navy (Nuclear Power) veteran with over 15 years of experience architecting financial operations and leading multi-entity organizations. I am now making a deliberate, hands-on pivot to a career in data, with a long-term goal of becoming a Data Engineer.

My unique value proposition is the ability to bridge the gap between high-level business strategy and ground-level technical execution. I don't just analyze the data; I understand how to build the systems that produce it and translate the results into actionable business insights.

### Current Focus & Learning Journey

I am currently deepening my technical toolkit to complement my deep background in finance and systems architecture. My primary focus is on:

-   **Data Engineering Fundamentals:** Building robust ETL pipelines, data modeling, and working with cloud data platforms.
-   **Advanced Analytics & Visualization:** Using Python, SQL, and BI tools to uncover insights and tell compelling stories with data.
-   **Cloud Technologies:** Currently enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, with a focus on BigQuery and related GCP tools.
